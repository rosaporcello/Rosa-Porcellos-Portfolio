      <p class="paragraph">
        My name is Rosa Porcello, and I am a junior at UWEC! I am majoring Graphic Communications and pursuing a
        certificate in Business Communications. I have a background in customer service, and graphic design. My very
        first job was at a bakery at my hometown River Falls. It was very simple but it taught me how to be comfortable
        talking to customers and how to be a decent employee! After that I created some designs for my family's small
        tshirt business, which made me realize my love for graphic design, and made me realize I wanted to do it as a
        career. I worked at some other jobs as well, such as front desk at a hotel and a merchandiser/cashier at
        goodwill, which helped me learn a range of customer service skills. I currently work at the front desk at UWEC
        Printing services, where I am able to learn how to print a range of products, and how to format and create
        products in a way that is printed most effectively. My goal for the near future is to find an internship where
        I will be able to work as a graphic designer for a company that I am passionate about, so I am able to continue
        designing with a purpose!
